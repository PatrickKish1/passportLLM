This information is subject to change and it is always best to verify with the Japanese Embassy or official government websites.\n\nHowever, if you plan to stay for longer than 90 days, work, or engage in activities outside of tourism and business, you will need to apply for a specific visa.

You can find the most up-to-date fee information on the Japanese embassy or consulate website.\n\nFor a visa application, you will typically need to provide the following documents:\n\n1. A valid passport with at least six months of validity beyond your intended stay in Japan.\n2. A completed visa application form.\n3. One passport-size photograph.\n4. Proof of financial means, such as bank statements or a letter from your employer.\n5. A letter explaining the purpose of your visit.\n6.
